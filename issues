issue #1: Cannot Undeploy a web-app completely in Tomcat 7

This is very common in Windows environment but there is a solution :
Open context.xml from /tomcat/conf folder and modify the context to match this :
<Context antiJARLocking="true" antiResourceLocking="true">


deploy:
    mvn tomcat7:deploy
undeploy:
    mvn tomcat7:undeploy
redeploy:
    mvn tomcat7:redeploy
